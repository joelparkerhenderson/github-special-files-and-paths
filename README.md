<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

GitHub special files can typically be written with a variety of formats and file name extensions:

  * Freeform text, such as `README` or `README.txt`.

  * Markup formats, such as `README.markdown` or `README.asciidoc` - see [markups](https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/README.md#markups)

  * Custom syntaxes, such as the file `CODEOWNERS`.

GitHub special files are typically located at the repository top level or in special paths:

  * `/.github` is a hidden dot file directory.

  * `/docs` is a typical documentation directory.

  * Custom paths, such as the directory `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.

The special files and paths are sometimes also known as community health files, recommended repository files, well-known configurations, etc.

For a general overview see [building a strong community](https://help.github.com/categories/building-a-strong-community/) and [GitHub's Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).

  * Help: <https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/>

  * Directory: `./`

  * Awesome: list: <https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme>

A README file describes your project, what it does, why it is useful, etc. 

This file is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository, because GitHub automatically shows this file to repository visitors.  README files in subdirectories will display when visitors view that subdirectory in the GitHub website.

<h3 id="profile-readme">Profile README</h3>

  * Repository: `<username>/<username>`

  * Help: <https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme>

A README file in the root of a repository that has the same name as your username, e.g. [mojombo/mojombo](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo), will be shown at the top of your profile page.

<h3 id="org-readme">Organization README</h3>

  * Repository: `<org>/.github` or `<org>/.github-private`

  * Help: <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile>

A README file in the root of an organization repository called `.github`, .e.g. [github/.github](https://github.com/github/.github), will be shown to visitors at the top of the organization profile page.  An equivalent file in the root of an organization repository called `.github-private` will be shown to logged in organization members.

  * Help: <https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/>

  * Directories: `./` `./.github/` `./docs/`

This file defines individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository. 

Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository.


<h2 id="issue-template">ISSUE_TEMPLATE</h2>

  * File: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`

  * Help: <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/>

  * Directories: `./` `./.github/` `./docs/` or `./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

  * Awesome: list: <https://github.com/devspace/awesome-github-templates>

When you add an issue template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents in the issue body. Templates customize and standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

See <https://blog.github.com/2018-01-25-multiple-issue-and-pull-request-templates/>

To add multiple issue templates to a repository create an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory in your project root. Within that `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory you can create as many issue templates as you need, for example `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bugs.md`.

Default `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` files that apply across all repositories can be placed in an organizations's `.github` repository, see <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.

This file triggers project contributors to automatically see the template's contents in a new pull request body. The template can customize and standardize the information you'd like included when contributors create pull requests.

See <https://blog.github.com/2018-01-25-multiple-issue-and-pull-request-templates/>

You can create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` subdirectory in any of the supported folders to contain multiple pull request templates. Use the template query parameter to specify the template that will automatically fill the pull request body. For more information, see "[About automation for issues and pull requests with query parameters.](https://help.github.com/articles/about-automation-for-issues-and-pull-requests-with-query-parameters/)"

  * Directories: `./` or special case `inst/CITATION` for R packages.

This file explains how you would like people to cite your work. The citation file format is plain text with human-readable and machine-readable citation information.

When you add this file to the default branch root directory of your repository, then GitHub automatically links to it from the repository landing page.


<h2 id="funding-yml">FUNDING.yml</h2>

  * File: `.github/FUNDING.yml`

  * Help: <https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository>

You can configure your sponsor button by adding a  file in your repository on the default branch. You can configure the button to include sponsored developers in GitHub Sponsors, external funding platforms, or a custom funding URL.

  * File: `.github/dependabot.yml`

  * Help: <https://github.com/dependabot>

Dependabot is a GitHub tool that provides automated dependency updates. To enable updates, create a Dependabot configuration file and add it to a repository. The file describes the dependencies to update, where dependency manifests are located, etc. If Dependbot discovers that an update is available, then Dependabot sends you a pull request to update your dependency.


<h2 id="workflows">Workflows</h2>

  * Directory: `.github/workflows`

  * Help: <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions>

A workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. You must create a YAML file to define your workflow configuration. Workflow files use YAML syntax, and must have file extension `.yml` or `.yaml`.
