# CONTRIBUTORS

This is a placeholder file that you can customize as you wish. TODO.

* File: `CONTRIBUTORS` or `CONTRIBUTORS.txt` or `CONTRIBUTORS.md` etc. 

* Directories: `./` `./.github/` `./docs/`

This file explains who has contributed to the project. When we use a `CONTRIBUTORS` file in our projects, we ask people how they want to be listed, such as by their name, handle, email address, website link, etc. 

Compare this file to the file `AUTHORS`.
