When you add an issue template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents in the issue body. Templates customize and standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

See <https://blog.github.com/2018-01-25-multiple-issue-and-pull-request-templates/>

To add multiple issue templates to a repository create an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory in your project root. Within that `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory you can create as many issue templates as you need, for example `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bugs.md`.

Default `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` files that apply across all repositories can be placed in an organization's `.github` repository, see <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.
