# SUPPORT

This is a placeholder file that you can customize as you wish. TODO.

* File: `SUPPORT` or `SUPPORT.txt` or `SUPPORT.md` etc. 

* Directories: `./` `./.github/` `./docs/`

This file explains how a reader can get help with the repository and project. GitHub links this file on the page "New Issue". Unlike the "CONTRIBUTING" file, GitHub does not link this file on the page "New Pull Request".

Default `SUPPORT` files that apply across all repositories can be placed in an organization's `.github` repository, see <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.
