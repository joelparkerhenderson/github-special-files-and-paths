FUNDING.yml

* File: `.github/FUNDING.yml`

* Help: <https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository>

You can configure your sponsor button by adding a  file in your repository on the default branch. You can configure the button to include sponsored developers in GitHub Sponsors, external funding platforms, or a custom funding URL.

Default `FUNDING.yml` files that apply across all repositories can be placed in an organization's `.github` repository, see <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.
